# GPlatesClassStruggle

prototyping for GPlates plate reconstructions as a python class

Requires:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- healpy
- pygplates
- PlateTectonicTools (https://github.com/EarthByte/PlateTectonicTools)

[The 'ReconstructionPlot' class also requires GMT (called from outside python) and moviepy (to make animations), and is only really a 'concept' that should be superceded once gmt-python and pygplates can be properly connected. Still kinda works though]
